## Smart Pantry & AI Chef: A Journey into Practical AI

I developed this project to bridge the gap between theoretical data structures and the practical application of Artificial Intelligence. Beyond just managing a kitchen inventory, the goal was to understand the nuances of full-stack integration and the real-time processing of generative AI.

### Why I Built This

* **Problem-Solving Core**: I wanted to solve the everyday "what should I cook?" dilemma by creating a system that thinks logically based on available constraints.
* **Learning Integration**: This was my deep dive into connecting a Flask backend with the Gemini API, requiring a solid grasp of asynchronous requests and secure environment variable management.
* **Architecture Understanding**: Moving from local scripts to a hosted environment on Vercel taught me the importance of deployment pipelines and maintaining a clean, production-ready codebase.

### Technical Evolution

* **State Management**: Developed a dynamic pantry system that tracks inventory levels, which served as a practical exercise in data persistence.
* **AI Prompt Engineering**: Refined how the system communicates with the Gemini API to ensure the "Chef" generates recipes that are actually feasible with the ingredients provided.
* **Full-Stack Workflow**: Balanced the aesthetic requirements of the frontend with the logic-heavy demands of the Python backend.
